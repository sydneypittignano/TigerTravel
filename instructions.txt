Making this to remind myself how to get started

STARTING WORK:
1. Open two terminals
2. cd into TigerTravel on both
3. Activate the postgres server (doesn't matter where):
    pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
4. In one terminal, start the server for our app and specify a port
    python runserver.py [port]
5. In the other terminal, run the app with the same port
    python tigertravel.py [port]
6. On a web browser, navigate to
    localhost:[port]
7. Get to work!


ENDING WORK:
1. Ctrl+C in the terminal where the server is running
2. Deactivate virtual environments in both terminals
3. Stop the postgres server
    pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres stop
